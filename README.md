DIY remix of [Public Labs version of the Simple Hackteria microscope](https://publiclab.org/notes/partsandcrafts/11-26-2017/building-a-raspberry-pi-microscope) following the [Public Lab Build Guide](https://publiclab.org/notes/partsandcrafts/11-26-2017/building-a-raspberry-pi-microscope) while looking lovingly at the [OpenFlexure Microscope project](https://github.com/rwb27/openflexure_microscope). We aim to use it for a popup microscopic Twitch stream while doing a review-by-making of popular DIY microscopes. The RPi camera to twitch function uses [MakeSpaceLive](https://github.com/DynamicDevices/makespacelive) which Alex Lennon and Matt at [DoES Liverpool](http://doesliverpool.com) kindly made to help watch making live and share across a federation of maker spaces.

I also modified a piZero camera with a 3D printed case included here so you can connect to a [Foldscope](https://www.foldscope.com)

### Ethics

Why ethical? In the first instance it is open source and freely available and is meant to help people access basic microscopy.

However our main aim is to develop a microfluidic aquarium to add-on to the stage so that microorganisms don't have to dehydrate and die on the slide which is common practice only to provoke thinking about how we work with and learn from microorganisms when we observe them and what that might mean in terms of ethics and waste.

The micro aquarium is still a work in progress.

## MET Matrix

[MET Matrix](MET_Matrix.md)

Map out the energy toxicity matrix so we trace the complete carbon cost of your build using the [Materials Energy Toxicity Matrix](http://thingscon2018.productscience.net/) developed at OMGCLIMATE 2019. We found this via [@mrchrisadams](https://twitter.com/mrchrisadams) excellent talk on [Reducing Carbon In the Digital Realm](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_uTPiW5aMCwFhZcpLDxjY-AQMgDmHIyUEZQQ-G6XXq8/edit#slide=id.g5d9e2f62d2_0_42) at [Maintenance Festival 2019 in Liverpool](https://festivalofmaintenance.org.uk)
