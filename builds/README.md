## Builds

Use the `.svg` files with Inkscape or similar to modify and export your own `.dxf` files for lasercutting in 3mm laser grade acrylic tested with [Gerald the Large Laser Cutter](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/wiki/LaserCutterGerald) in DoESLiverpool.

Print out the `.stl` files with a 3D printer using the cellulose based extrusion material PLA. Tested with [Felicity the Ultimaker B.V. 2](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/wiki/Ultimaker) at DoES Liverpool

The `PiCameraOptics_Cover_Adapted.stl` file needs Cura or similar to generate appropriate `.gcode` files for printing.

These optics provide a screw fit for standard microscope optics. We bought ours from [Ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/4X-10X-20X-40X-60X-100X-Achromatic-Objective-Lens-for-Biological-Microscope-185-/182554782667)

You'll also need a 100mm M6 flat head steel coach bolt screw and nut set, which we [sourced from ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/M6-6mm-COACH-BOLTS-CUP-SQUARE-CARRIAGE-BOLTS-SCREWS-WITH-HEXAGON-NUTS-BZP-ZINC-/111969780777) and 3 smaller 20mm M6 phillips head nut and bolt set and 3 additional M6 nuts.

We will be updating a full BOM file and details soon, plus and entry for a [Materials Energy Toxicity Matrix](http://thingscon2018.productscience.net/)
