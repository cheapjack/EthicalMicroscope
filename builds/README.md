## Builds

Use the `.svg` files with Inkscape or similar to modify and export your own `.dxf` files for lasercutting in 3mm laser grade acrylic tested with [Gerald the Large Laser Cutter](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/wiki/LaserCutterGerald) in DoESLiverpool.

Print out the `.stl` files with a 3D printer using the cellulose based extrusion material PLA. Tested with [Felicity the Ultimaker B.V. 2](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/wiki/Ultimaker) at DoES Liverpool

The `PiCameraOptics_Cover_Adapted.stl` file is the master file which has all the 3D printed parts needed to connect up your Raspberry Pi HD camera, after removing it's lens as described in the tutorials listed, to a microscope optic. You can screw in and out different optics where necessary. The stage for holding the slides and aquarium can be made from the cut files in `MicroscopeStage.svg` or `MicroscopeStageSheet.dxf`. For 3D printing you'll need software like Cura or Slicr to generate appropriate `.gcode` 'slicing' files for printing.

The PiCamera & cover optics provide a screw fit for standard microscope optics. We bought ours from [Ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/4X-10X-20X-40X-60X-100X-Achromatic-Objective-Lens-for-Biological-Microscope-185-/182554782667)

You'll also need a 100mm M6 flat head steel coach bolt screw and nut set, which we [sourced from ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/M6-6mm-COACH-BOLTS-CUP-SQUARE-CARRIAGE-BOLTS-SCREWS-WITH-HEXAGON-NUTS-BZP-ZINC-/111969780777) and 3 smaller 20mm M6 phillips head nut and bolt set and 3 additional M6 nuts.

We will be updating a full BOM file and details soon, plus and entry for a [Materials Energy Toxicity Matrix](http://thingscon2018.productscience.net/)
